Figure 1: An attempt at creating a graph detailing the differences between eigenvalues, this was the energy level/frequency level of each allowed state, and the differences between them.

2x2_Tensor_Product is the derivation used for the 4x4 matrix Hamiltonian obtained, which was diagonalised to find eigenvalues

The code provided ("INVESTIGATIONS_COUPLED_SPIN") is the code used to get all figures seen in the report, and Figure 1 in this repository.
